Description: This script codes a customer network detection, it identifies the most influential customers in a network
of customers, crafts messages to those leading customers, and sends messages to their closest connections.

# Next, we will read the dataset from a CSV file and create a directed graph from the connections.
df = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')

# Assuming that each customer has a 'influence' attribute that represents their influence in the network, we can use
# the PageRank algorithm to identify the most influential customers, this will give us the 10 most influential
# customers in the network.
